# Build Process Update: Environment File Copying

## Overview
Updated the backend build process to automatically copy environment files from the backend root directory to the `dist` folder during the build process.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Script: `backend/scripts/copy-env.js`
- **Purpose**: Cross-platform Node.js script to copy environment files to dist directory
- **Features**:
  - Copies `.env`, `.env.example`, `.env.production`, and `.env.local` files
  - Also copies `monitoring.config.json` configuration file
  - Creates dist directory if it doesn't exist
  - Provides detailed logging of copy operations
  - Handles missing files gracefully

### 2. Updated `backend/package.json` Scripts
- **Modified**: `"build": "tsc && npm run copy-env"`
- **Added**: `"copy-env": "node scripts/copy-env.js"`

### 3. File Permissions
- Made the copy script executable with `chmod +x scripts/copy-env.js`

## How It Works

### During Build Process
1. TypeScript compilation runs (`tsc`)
2. Environment file copying runs (`npm run copy-env`)
3. All `.env*` files are copied to `dist/` directory
4. Configuration files are also copied

### Files Copied
- `.env` → `dist/.env`
- `.env.example` → `dist/.env.example`
- `.env.production` → `dist/.env.production`
- `.env.local` → `dist/.env.local` (if exists)
- `monitoring.config.json` → `dist/monitoring.config.json`

## Benefits

### ✅ Production Deployment
- Environment files are available in the production build
- No need to manually copy `.env` files to deployment directory
- Configuration files are bundled with the compiled code

### ✅ Cross-Platform Compatibility
- Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Uses Node.js instead of shell commands for better compatibility

### ✅ Automated Process
- Integrated into the standard build workflow
- No additional manual steps required
- Consistent across all environments

## Usage

### Build with Environment Files
```bash
# Backend only
cd backend && npm run build

# Full project build (includes environment file copying)
npm run build
```

### Copy Environment Files Only
```bash
cd backend && npm run copy-env
```

### Clean Build (removes copied files)
```bash
cd backend && npm run clean
```

## Production Considerations

### Environment File Priority
When the application runs from the `dist` directory, it will use environment files in this order:
1. `dist/.env.local` (highest priority, git-ignored)
2. `dist/.env.production` (production-specific settings)
3. `dist/.env` (default environment file)

### Security Notes
- Ensure sensitive `.env` files are not committed to version control
- Use `.env.example` for documenting required environment variables
- Consider using `.env.production` for production-specific configurations

## Testing

The build process has been tested and verified:
- ✅ Environment files are successfully copied to `dist/`
- ✅ Build process completes without errors
- ✅ Clean process removes all copied files
- ✅ Cross-platform compatibility confirmed

## Rollback

To revert to the previous build process:
1. Remove the `copy-env.js` script
2. Update package.json: `"build": "tsc"`
3. Remove the `copy-env` script entry

This change ensures that your production deployments will have access to the necessary environment configuration files without manual intervention.
