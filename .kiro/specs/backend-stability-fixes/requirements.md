# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical backend stability issues that were preventing the CopyTrade Pro application from starting in development mode. The primary issues included Express.js version compatibility problems causing path-to-regexp errors, CORS configuration issues blocking frontend API calls, and TypeScript compilation errors.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Express.js Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the backend server to start without path-to-regexp errors, so that I can develop and test the application locally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend server starts THEN it SHALL NOT throw path-to-regexp TypeError exceptions
2. WHEN using Express.js THEN the system SHALL use a stable version compatible with all middleware
3. WHEN route parameters are defined THEN they SHALL be properly parsed without syntax errors
4. IF Express version conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and resolution steps

### Requirement 2: CORS Configuration for Development

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want API calls to work seamlessly in development mode, so that I can test features without CORS blocking requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in development mode THEN the system SHALL allow all origins for CORS requests
2. WHEN in production mode THEN the system SHALL enforce strict CORS origin validation
3. WHEN preflight OPTIONS requests are made THEN they SHALL be handled correctly with proper headers
4. WHEN debugging CORS issues THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logging and testing tools
5. IF CORS errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear troubleshooting guidance

### Requirement 3: TypeScript Type Safety

**User Story:** As a developer, I want TypeScript compilation to succeed without errors, so that I can benefit from type safety and IDE support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TypeScript files are compiled THEN there SHALL be no compilation errors
2. WHEN function parameters are used THEN they SHALL have explicit type annotations
3. WHEN imports are declared THEN unused imports SHALL be removed or documented
4. WHEN error handling is implemented THEN error parameters SHALL be properly typed
5. IF TypeScript errors occur THEN they SHALL be clearly identified and fixable

### Requirement 4: Route Organization and Mounting

**User Story:** As a developer, I want API routes to be properly organized and accessible, so that frontend applications can reliably call backend endpoints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN routes are mounted THEN they SHALL use proper namespacing to avoid conflicts
2. WHEN route parameters are defined THEN they SHALL follow consistent naming conventions
3. WHEN multiple route files exist THEN they SHALL be organized logically by feature
4. WHEN testing routes THEN there SHALL be tools to verify route accessibility
5. IF route conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 5: Development Tools and Debugging

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive tools to diagnose and fix backend issues, so that I can quickly resolve problems during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN backend issues occur THEN there SHALL be automated fix scripts available
2. WHEN testing CORS THEN there SHALL be a dedicated testing tool
3. WHEN debugging routes THEN there SHALL be tools to test individual route imports
4. WHEN documentation is needed THEN there SHALL be comprehensive troubleshooting guides
5. IF issues persist THEN there SHALL be step-by-step resolution procedures

### Requirement 6: Environment Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want environment-specific configurations to work correctly, so that development and production environments behave appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in development mode THEN the system SHALL use permissive settings for easier testing
2. WHEN in production mode THEN the system SHALL enforce strict security settings
3. WHEN environment variables are used THEN they SHALL be properly validated
4. WHEN switching environments THEN configuration changes SHALL be applied correctly
5. IF environment issues occur THEN there SHALL be validation tools available

### Requirement 7: Dependency Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want package dependencies to be compatible and stable, so that the application runs reliably across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dependencies are installed THEN they SHALL be compatible with each other
2. WHEN major version updates occur THEN compatibility SHALL be verified before adoption
3. WHEN dependency conflicts arise THEN there SHALL be clear resolution strategies
4. WHEN package.json is updated THEN type definitions SHALL match runtime versions
5. IF dependency issues occur THEN there SHALL be automated fix procedures
