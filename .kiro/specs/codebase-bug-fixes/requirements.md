# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for fixing critical bugs and flow issues throughout the CopyTrade Pro codebase. The application currently suffers from multiple integration problems, UI inconsistencies, error handling gaps, and broker connection issues that prevent proper functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Broker Integration Stability

**User Story:** As a trader, I want reliable broker connections that maintain session state and handle authentication flows properly, so that I can execute trades without unexpected disconnections or authentication failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user connects to any supported broker THEN the connection SHALL remain stable throughout the trading session
2. WHEN a broker session expires THEN the system SHALL automatically attempt to refresh the session using stored credentials
3. WHEN OAuth authentication is required THEN the system SHALL properly handle the complete OAuth flow without losing state
4. WHEN multiple broker accounts are connected THEN each account SHALL maintain independent session state
5. IF session refresh fails THEN the system SHALL prompt the user for re-authentication with clear error messaging
6. WHEN broker API calls fail THEN the system SHALL implement proper retry logic with exponential backoff

### Requirement 2: Error Handling and User Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear and actionable error messages when something goes wrong, so that I can understand what happened and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any API call fails THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages instead of technical errors
2. WHEN network connectivity issues occur THEN the system SHALL distinguish between network errors and application errors
3. WHEN broker authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific guidance on credential requirements
4. WHEN order placement fails THEN the system SHALL show the exact reason and suggest corrective actions
5. IF multiple operations fail simultaneously THEN the system SHALL aggregate errors in a comprehensible format
6. WHEN errors are temporary THEN the system SHALL provide retry options with appropriate timing

### Requirement 3: UI Consistency and Data Flow

**User Story:** As a user, I want a consistent and responsive interface that accurately reflects the current state of my accounts and orders, so that I can make informed trading decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN account data is loaded THEN all UI components SHALL display consistent account information
2. WHEN orders are placed THEN the UI SHALL immediately reflect the pending state and update when confirmed
3. WHEN switching between pages THEN the application SHALL maintain state consistency across components
4. WHEN real-time updates occur THEN the UI SHALL update without requiring manual refresh
5. IF data loading fails THEN the UI SHALL show appropriate loading states and error fallbacks
6. WHEN forms are submitted THEN validation SHALL occur before API calls with clear field-level feedback

### Requirement 4: Order Management Reliability

**User Story:** As a trader, I want order placement and tracking to work reliably across all connected broker accounts, so that I can execute my trading strategy without technical obstacles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN placing orders on multiple accounts THEN each order SHALL be processed independently with individual success/failure tracking
2. WHEN order status changes THEN the system SHALL automatically update the order list without manual refresh
3. WHEN retrieving order history THEN the system SHALL handle pagination and filtering correctly
4. WHEN canceling or modifying orders THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback and update the order status
5. IF broker-specific order formats differ THEN the system SHALL properly transform orders through the unified interface
6. WHEN order placement fails on some accounts THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which accounts succeeded and which failed

### Requirement 5: Account Management Consistency

**User Story:** As a user, I want account activation and management to work seamlessly across all supported brokers, so that I can maintain active connections to all my trading accounts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN activating accounts THEN the system SHALL handle both direct login and OAuth flows consistently
2. WHEN account credentials are stored THEN they SHALL be properly encrypted and retrievable for session refresh
3. WHEN multiple accounts exist for the same broker THEN each account SHALL be managed independently
4. WHEN account status changes THEN the UI SHALL immediately reflect the new status across all components
5. IF account activation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages and retry options
6. WHEN deactivating accounts THEN the system SHALL properly clean up sessions and cached data

### Requirement 6: Real-time Data Synchronization

**User Story:** As a trader, I want real-time updates for market data, order status, and account information, so that I can react quickly to market changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN WebSocket connections are established THEN they SHALL remain stable and automatically reconnect if disconnected
2. WHEN real-time data is received THEN it SHALL be properly validated and distributed to relevant UI components
3. WHEN connection issues occur THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade to polling mode
4. WHEN multiple users access the same data THEN updates SHALL be synchronized across all sessions
5. IF real-time updates fail THEN the system SHALL provide fallback mechanisms to ensure data freshness
6. WHEN subscribing to market data THEN the system SHALL handle subscription management efficiently

### Requirement 7: Performance and Resource Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to perform efficiently without memory leaks or excessive resource consumption, so that I can use it for extended trading sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading large datasets THEN the system SHALL implement proper pagination and virtualization
2. WHEN caching data THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate cache invalidation strategies
3. WHEN managing WebSocket connections THEN the system SHALL properly clean up resources on disconnect
4. WHEN handling multiple concurrent operations THEN the system SHALL manage resource allocation efficiently
5. IF memory usage grows excessively THEN the system SHALL implement garbage collection and cleanup routines
6. WHEN performing background tasks THEN the system SHALL not block the main UI thread

### Requirement 8: Development and Debugging Support

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive logging and debugging tools, so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information with context
2. WHEN debugging is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide verbose logging without affecting performance
3. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL log request/response details for troubleshooting
4. WHEN state changes occur THEN the system SHALL provide audit trails for debugging
5. IF production issues arise THEN the system SHALL provide sufficient logging to diagnose problems
6. WHEN performance issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide metrics and profiling information
