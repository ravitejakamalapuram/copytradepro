# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive error logging and monitoring system for CopyTrade Pro that captures, tracks, and stores detailed error information across the entire application stack. The system will provide detailed error tracking with timestamps, trace IDs, and contextual information to enable developers to analyze errors and create actionable tasks for resolution.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive error logging across all application layers, so that I can identify and resolve issues before they impact users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs in the backend THEN the system SHALL log the error with timestamp, trace ID, error type, stack trace, and contextual information
2. WHEN an error occurs in the frontend THEN the system SHALL capture the error with UI context, user actions, and browser information
3. WHEN a request enters the system THEN the system SHALL assign a unique trace ID that tracks the entire API lifecycle including all operations, database calls, and external API interactions
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL use the trace ID to correlate errors with the complete request context and flow

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want structured error logs with consistent formatting, so that I can quickly analyze and debug issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error is logged THEN the system SHALL include timestamp in ISO 8601 format
2. WHEN a backend error occurs THEN the system SHALL tag it with "BE" identifier and include service/controller context
3. WHEN a frontend error occurs THEN the system SHALL tag it with "UI" identifier and include component/page context
4. WHEN an error is logged THEN the system SHALL include severity level (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG)
5. WHEN an error involves external APIs THEN the system SHALL log request/response details and API endpoint information

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want detailed error context and categorization, so that I can quickly understand and create tasks to fix issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors are logged THEN the system SHALL categorize them by type (API, Database, Authentication, UI, Trading, etc.)
2. WHEN errors are stored THEN the system SHALL include sufficient context for reproducing and debugging the issue
3. WHEN broker API errors occur THEN the system SHALL log the specific broker, API endpoint, request/response details
4. WHEN database errors occur THEN the system SHALL log query details, connection state, and affected collections
5. WHEN authentication errors occur THEN the system SHALL log user context, session details, and security-relevant information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want error metrics and dashboards in the admin panel, so that I can monitor application health and identify issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors are logged THEN the system SHALL maintain error count metrics by type, severity, and time period
2. WHEN accessing the admin dashboard THEN the system SHALL display error logs with filtering and search capabilities
3. WHEN viewing error details in admin panel THEN the system SHALL show error distribution across different application components
4. WHEN using the admin dashboard THEN the system SHALL provide real-time error monitoring and historical trends
5. WHEN viewing errors in admin panel THEN the system SHALL allow drilling down into specific error details and context

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want error context and debugging information, so that I can reproduce and fix issues efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL capture user session information, request parameters, application state, and the complete trace ID lifecycle
2. WHEN a trading error occurs THEN the system SHALL log broker context, order details, and market conditions
3. WHEN a database error occurs THEN the system SHALL include query details, connection state, and data context
4. WHEN a frontend error occurs THEN the system SHALL capture component props, state, and user interaction history
5. WHEN an error is logged THEN the system SHALL include environment information (version, deployment, configuration)

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want error log persistence and searchability, so that I can analyze historical issues and trends.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors are logged THEN the system SHALL persist them to a searchable database with proper indexing
2. WHEN searching error logs THEN the system SHALL support filtering by date range, severity, component, trace ID, and allow viewing the complete request lifecycle for any trace ID
3. WHEN storing error logs THEN the system SHALL implement log rotation and retention policies
4. WHEN exporting error data THEN the system SHALL support multiple formats (JSON, CSV, structured logs)

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want error aggregation and analysis tools, so that I can identify patterns and prioritize fixes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing error logs THEN the system SHALL provide aggregation by error type, frequency, and time periods
2. WHEN analyzing errors THEN the system SHALL show which components/services are most error-prone
3. WHEN errors occur repeatedly THEN the system SHALL group similar errors and show occurrence patterns
4. WHEN requesting error analysis THEN the system SHALL provide summaries that can be used to create fix tasks
5. WHEN exporting error data THEN the system SHALL format it in a way that's useful for creating development tasks
