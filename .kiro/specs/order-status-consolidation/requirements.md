# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The CopyTrade Pro application currently has duplicate order status endpoints and inconsistent database methods that create confusion and maintenance overhead. There are two separate endpoints for checking order status (`GET /order-status/:brokerOrderId` and `POST /check-order-status`) and inconsistent database interface methods that handle different ID formats. This consolidation effort aims to standardize the order status checking functionality, eliminate duplicate code paths, and create a consistent interface across all brokers while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the system, I want a single, consistent order status endpoint, so that the API is easier to understand and maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system provides order status functionality THEN there SHALL be one primary endpoint for checking order status
2. WHEN legacy endpoints exist THEN they SHALL redirect to the primary endpoint to maintain backward compatibility
3. WHEN the primary endpoint is called THEN it SHALL work consistently across all supported brokers
4. WHEN order status is requested THEN the response format SHALL be standardized regardless of the broker

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer working with the database layer, I want consistent database methods for order retrieval, so that I can work with a unified interface regardless of the underlying storage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing order history by ID THEN the database interface SHALL accept string IDs consistently
2. WHEN the databaseCompatibility layer is used THEN it SHALL handle both MongoDB ObjectIds and legacy numeric IDs seamlessly
3. WHEN database methods are called THEN they SHALL return consistent data structures across different storage backends
4. WHEN ID conversion is needed THEN the compatibility layer SHALL handle the transformation transparently

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want a single API endpoint to check order status, so that I don't need to maintain multiple integration points.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend needs to check order status THEN it SHALL use the primary POST endpoint
2. WHEN the frontend makes order status requests THEN the response format SHALL be consistent and predictable
3. WHEN errors occur during order status checking THEN the frontend SHALL receive standardized error responses
4. WHEN the API changes THEN existing frontend code SHALL continue to work without modification

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want clean, maintainable code without duplicate implementations, so that the system is easier to debug and extend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN order status functionality is implemented THEN there SHALL be no duplicate controller methods
2. WHEN database access is needed THEN there SHALL be a single, well-defined interface for order retrieval
3. WHEN new brokers are added THEN they SHALL integrate with the standardized order status system
4. WHEN debugging issues THEN there SHALL be clear logging and error handling throughout the consolidated system
