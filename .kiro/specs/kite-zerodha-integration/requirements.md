# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds Kite (Zerodha) API integration to CopyTrade Pro, enabling users to connect their Zerodha accounts for multi-broker trading and copy trading functionality. The integration will follow the same plugin architecture as existing Fyers and Shoonya implementations, providing seamless broker abstraction through the unified broker interface.

Zerodha's KiteConnect API is one of the most popular broker APIs in the Indian market, supporting trading across NSE, BSE, NFO, BFO, and MCX exchanges. This integration will complete the core broker support for professional traders and portfolio managers.
