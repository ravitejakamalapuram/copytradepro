- **Health Check Endpoints**: Multiple health check endpoints for load balancers and monitoring tools
- **Performance Tracking**: Automatic API performance monitoring with request/response metrics
- **SLA Monitoring**: Service Level Agreement tracking with availability and performance metrics

**Key Files:**
- `backend/src/services/productionMonitoringService.ts` - Core monitoring service
- `backend/src/services/alertingService.ts` - External alerting integration
- `backend/src/controllers/monitoringController.ts` - Monitoring API endpoints
- `backend/src/middleware/performanceMonitoring.ts` - Automatic performance tracking
- `frontend/src/pages/MonitoringDashboard.tsx` - Real-time monitoring dashboard

### 2. Controlled Deployment System ✅
- **Feature Flags**: Gradual rollout capability with user-based targeting
- **Deployment Script**: Automated deployment with backup and rollback capabilities
- **Health Validation**: Comprehensive health checks and deployment validation
- **Rollback Mechanism**: Automatic rollback on deployment failures

**Key Files:**
- `backend/scripts/health-check.js` - Comprehensive health check validation
- `backend/scripts/validate-deployment.js` - Post-deployment validation
- `backend/src/services/featureFlagService.ts` - Feature flag management
- `backend/monitoring.config.json` - Monitoring configuration

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling Integration ✅
- **Monitoring Integration**: Error handler now reports to monitoring system
- **Performance Metrics**: All API errors are tracked for performance analysis
- **Structured Logging**: Enhanced error context and classification

## Deployment Process

### Phase 1: Preparation
1. **Backup Creation**: Automatic backup of current deployment
2. **Dependency Installation**: Clean installation of all dependencies
3. **Build Process**: Compilation of all application components

### Phase 2: Deployment
1. **Application Shutdown**: Graceful shutdown of existing processes
2. **Application Startup**: Launch new version with monitoring
3. **Health Validation**: Multi-endpoint health verification
4. **Deployment Validation**: Comprehensive functionality testing

### Phase 3: Monitoring
1. **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous system health monitoring
2. **Alert Configuration**: Automatic alerting on threshold breaches
3. **Performance Tracking**: Response time and error rate monitoring

## Monitoring Capabilities

### System Metrics
- **Memory Usage**: Real-time memory consumption tracking
- **CPU Load**: System load average monitoring
- **Response Times**: API response time percentiles (average, 95th, 99th)
- **Error Rates**: Request success/failure rate tracking
- **Active Connections**: WebSocket connection monitoring

### Alert Rules
- **High Memory Usage**: Alert at 85% memory usage
- **Critical Memory Usage**: Critical alert at 95% memory usage
- **High Error Rate**: Alert at 10% error rate
- **Critical Error Rate**: Critical alert at 25% error rate
- **Slow Response Time**: Alert at 5-second response time
- **Very Slow Response Time**: High priority alert at 10-second response time

### SLA Targets
- **Uptime**: 99.9% availability target
- **Response Time**: <2 seconds average response time
- **Error Rate**: <1% error rate target
- **Success Rate**: >99.5% success rate target

## Rollback Procedures

### Automatic Rollback
- Triggered on health check failures
- Triggered on deployment validation failures
- Configurable via `ROLLBACK_ON_FAILURE` environment variable

### Manual Rollback
```bash
# Check application status
cd backend && npm run health-check

# Restart application if needed
npm run dev
```

## Usage Instructions

### Deployment Commands
```bash
# Build and start application
npm run build
npm start

# Health check
cd backend && npm run health-check

# Development mode
npm run dev
```

### Monitoring Access
- **Health Check**: `GET /health` (public)
- **API Health**: `GET /api/health` (public)
- **Monitoring Dashboard**: `GET /api/monitoring/dashboard` (authenticated)
- **System Metrics**: `GET /api/monitoring/metrics` (authenticated)
- **SLA Metrics**: `GET /api/monitoring/sla` (authenticated)

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Deployment Configuration
DEPLOY_ENV=production
HEALTH_CHECK_TIMEOUT=30
ROLLBACK_ON_FAILURE=true
BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS=7

# Monitoring Configuration
LOG_LEVEL=info
ENABLE_REQUEST_LOGGING=true

# Alert Configuration (optional)
ALERT_EMAIL_ENABLED=true
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
ALERT_EMAIL_FROM=alerts@copytrade.pro
ALERT_EMAIL_TO=admin@copytrade.pro

SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/...

```

## Validation Results

The deployment validation script checks:
- ✅ Basic health endpoint functionality
- ✅ Monitoring system accessibility
- ✅ Error handling consistency
- ✅ API response format consistency
- ✅ Performance thresholds
- ✅ Security header presence
- ✅ Memory usage monitoring

## Success Metrics
